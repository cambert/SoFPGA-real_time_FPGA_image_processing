# SoFPGA
**System on FPGA** - my personal approach for Image/Video processing on FPGA. The main motivation is to bring back my PhD project back to life. I would like to cover the entire design cycle - software prototype, RTL simulation and FPGA development. 

*Motivation:*
- resurrect my project [Hardware architectures for infrared pedestrian detection systems](https://www.napier.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/research-search/outputs/hardware-architectures-for-infrared-pedestrian-detection-systems#downloads)
- brush up my RTL development
- learn new stuff

*Objectives:*
- use open source tools
   - Verilator HDL simulator
   - cocotb
 - move out from my comfort zone
   - Python 3
   - Altera FPGAs

*Goals:*
- create an open framework for FPGA image creation
- feed video stream into the FPGA, see object detection on the monitor screen
